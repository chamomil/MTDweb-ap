    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>

            working order.
        </li>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <p><strong id="whoshare">3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</strong></p>
    <p>
        <em><strong>In Short:</strong> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or
            with the following third parties.</em>
    </p>
    <p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during
            negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our
            business to another company.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong id="inforetain">4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
    <p>
        <em><strong>In Short: </strong>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined
            in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
        privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or
        other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for
        longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us. </p>
    <p>
        When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
        anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
        stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
        further processing until deletion is possible. </p>
    <p>
        <strong id="infosafe">5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></p>
    <p>
        <em><strong>In Short: </strong>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational
            and technical security measures.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to
        protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to
        secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
        guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
        unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
        modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
        personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a
        secure environment. </p>
    <p><strong id="infominors">6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</strong></p>
    <p>
        <em><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of
            age.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you
        represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such
        minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years
        of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such
        data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please
        contact us at bogdanov28c@gmail.com. </p>
    <p><strong id="privacyrights">7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></p>
    <p>
        <em><strong>In Short:</strong> You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>Withdrawing your consent:</u></strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal
        information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to
        withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the
        contact details provided in the section '<a
            href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>' below. </p>
    <p>
        However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when
        applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on
        lawful processing grounds other than consent. </p>
    <p><strong>Account Information</strong></p>
    <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you
        can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our
        active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems,
        assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements. </p>
    <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at Bogdanov28c@gmail.com.</p>
    <p><strong id="DNT">8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></p>
    <p>
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT')
        feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
        browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and
        implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
        other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
        tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
        version of this privacy notice. </p>
    <p>
        <strong id="policyupdates">9. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</strong></p>
    <p>
        <em><strong>In Short: </strong>Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant
            laws.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
        'Revised' date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material
        changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by
        directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of
        how we are protecting your information. </p>
